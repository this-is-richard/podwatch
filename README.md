# K8s for dummies

Yet another K8s GUI. For developers who are too bad at using terminal.

It can:

- Can see/switch contexts
- Can see/select pod in a context
- Can see (and copy!) logs from a pod

It cannot:

- create cluster, create pods, re-deploy pods...
- a lot more… please go back to kubectl

Why yet another GUI

- It’s free. No sign up. No questionnaire.
- No-brainer click-click-click check/select context/pod
